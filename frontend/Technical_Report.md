}
```

This service includes fallback mechanisms to ensure functionality even when the backend API is unavailable.

#### 4.1.5 API Integration

The frontend communicates with the backend through a typed API client:

```typescript
// Example API client for device operations
export const getDevices = (params?: DeviceListParams) => {
  return request.get<Response<DeviceListResponse>>('/api/devices', { params })
    .then((res) => {
      // Error handling and data processing
      return res.data;
    });
};

export const compareMice = (ids: string[]) => {
  return request
    .get<Response<ComparisonResult>>(`/api/devices/mice/compare?ids=${ids.join(',')}`)
    .then((res) => res.data);
};
```

#### 4.2.4 Database Integration

MongoDB is used for storing structured data with collections for different entity types:

```go
// Example of MongoDB integration
func InitMongoDB(ctx context.Context) error {
    clientOptions := options.Client().ApplyURI(config.GetConfig().MongoDB.URI)
    client, err := mongo.Connect(ctx, clientOptions)
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }
    
    // Test connection
    err = client.Ping(ctx, nil)
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }
    
    MongoClient = client
    return nil
}
```

#### 4.2.5 SVG Processing

The backend handles SVG data processing and comparison:

```go
// Example SVG comparison handler (simplified)
func CompareSVGs(c *gin.Context) {
    var req types.SVGCompareRequest
    if err := c.ShouldBindJSON(&req); err != nil {
        c.JSON(http.StatusBadRequest, gin.H{"error": err.Error()})
        return
    }
    
    devices, err := service.GetDeviceSVGs(req.DeviceIDs, req.View)
    if err != nil {
        c.JSON(http.StatusInternalServerError, gin.H{"error": "Failed to retrieve SVGs"})
        return
    }
    
    c.JSON(http.StatusOK, gin.H{
        "devices": devices,
        "scale": calculateScale(devices),
    })
}
```

#### 4.2.6 Authentication and Security

The application implements JWT-based authentication:

```go
// JWT token generation
func (s *Service) GenerateTokens(userID string) (*types.TokenPair, error) {
    accessToken, err := s.jwtService.GenerateAccessToken(userID)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    
    refreshToken, err := s.jwtService.GenerateRefreshToken(userID)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    
    return &types.TokenPair{
        AccessToken:  accessToken,
        RefreshToken: refreshToken,
    }, nil
}
```

Authorization middleware ensures protected endpoints are secure:

```go
// Auth middleware
func AuthMiddleware(jwtService jwt.Service) gin.HandlerFunc {
    return func(c *gin.Context) {
        token := extractToken(c)
        if token == "" {
            c.JSON(http.StatusUnauthorized, gin.H{"error": "Authorization token required"})
            c.Abort()
            return
        }
        
        userID, err := jwtService.ValidateToken(token)
        if err != nil {
            c.JSON(http.StatusUnauthorized, gin.H{"error": "Invalid token"})
            c.Abort()
            return
        }
        
        c.Set("userID", userID)
        c.Next()
    }
}
```

1. **devices**: Stores all peripheral device information
2. **users**: User accounts and preferences
3. **reviews**: User-submitted device reviews
4. **orders**: Order information
5. **carts**: Shopping cart data

#### 4.3.2 Indexes

To optimize query performance, several indexes are implemented:

- Compound indexes on device type and brand for filtering
- Text indexes on device names and descriptions for search
- Indexes on user IDs for quick access to user-related data

#### 4.3.3 Data Access Patterns

The data access layer implements repository patterns for clean separation:

```go
// Example device repository method
func (r *DeviceRepository) FindByID(ctx context.Context, id string) (*models.Device, error) {
    collection := r.db.Collection("devices")
    
    objID, err := primitive.ObjectIDFromHex(id)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    
    var device models.Device
    err = collection.FindOne(ctx, bson.M{"_id": objID}).Decode(&device)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    
    return &device, nil
}
```
